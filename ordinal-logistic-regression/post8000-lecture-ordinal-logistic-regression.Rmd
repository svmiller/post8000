# Ordinal Logistic Regression
## Introduction
### Goal for Today

*Discuss ordinal logistic regression (i.e. what to do when your DV is ordered-categorical).*

## Order Without Precision
### Order Without Precision

You may want to explain ordered-categorical responses like:

- Patient quality of life (excellent, good, fair, poor)
- Political philosophy (very liberal:very conservative on a five-point scale)
- Government spending (too low, about right, too high)
- Likert items (strongly agree:strongly disagree, five point-scale)

Problem: order is implied, but without precision.

- A vague magnifier of "very" separates "very liberal" from "liberal."
- "Strongly" separates "strongly agree" from "agree."

Scales are discrete, which will again break the assumptions of OLS.

### Simulated Ordinal Data

Observe again this simulated ordinal data, `D`.

```{r}
D %>% select(y, x1, x2)
```


### Simulated Ordinal Data

This simple `D` data frame is simulated where:

- $y$ is a five-item ordered-categorical variable (similar to a Likert item).
- $x1$ and $x2$ are random-normal with means 0 and SDs of 1.
- The effect of $x1$ on $y$ is 1.
- The effect of $x2$ on $y$ is .5.

*Importantly*: $y$ is sampled from individual probabilities for each observation.

- Probability is determined by cumulative logits.
- tl;dr: data aren't simulated as an OLS model.

### Simulated Ordinal Data

```{r}
M1 <-lm(y ~ x1 + x2, D)
broom::tidy(M1) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric,~round(.,2))%>% 
  kable(.,"markdown")
```

Not bad, but not correct.

###

```{r fitted-resid-plot-m1, echo=F, eval=T, fig.width = 14, fig.height = 8.5, warning = F, message = F}
D %>%
    mutate(fitted = fitted(M1),
           resid = resid(M1)) %>%
    ggplot(.,aes(fitted, resid)) + geom_point()  +
    theme_steve_web() +
    labs(x = "Fitted Values",
         y = "Residuals",
         title = "The Fitted-Residual Plot from the OLS Model We Just Ran",
         subtitle = "Patterns shouldn't emerge from a fitted-residual plot, but they will with discrete DVs like this.")

```

###

```{r qqplot-m1, echo=F, eval=T, fig.width = 14, fig.height = 8.5, warning = F, message = F}
D %>%
    mutate(resid = resid(M1)) %>%
    ggplot(.,aes(sample=resid)) + 
    geom_qq()  + theme_steve_web() +
    labs(x = "Theoretical Quantiles",
         y = "Sample Quantiles",
         title = "The Q-Q Plot from the OLS Model We Just Ran",
         subtitle = "The Q-Q plot is a little more sanguine about what we did, but notice that bend in the middle.")
```

### The Right Tool for the Right Job

```{r}
require(ordinal)
D$y_ord = ordered(D$y)
M2 <- clm(y_ord ~ x1 + x2, data = D)
broom::tidy(M2) %>%
    mutate_if(is.numeric, ~round(., 2)) %>%
  filter(coef.type == "location") %>%
    kable(., "markdown")
```

### What We Just Did

This was an ordinal logistic regression. Related names/terms:

- "Proportional odds logistic regression"
- "Cumulative link model"


## Conceptualizing an Ordinal Logistic Regression
### Conceptualizing an Ordinal Logistic Regression



1. There is an observed ordinal variable $Y$.
2. There is an underlying, *un*observed latent variable $Y^*$ that is continuous.

 ggplot(data.frame(x = c(-2.5, 2.5)), aes(x)) +
    stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                    xlim = c(-2.5,2.5), size=0,

        axis.ticks.y=element_blank()) +

       subtitle = "The idea is there is an underlying latent variable, but we're only observing five collapsed values of it.",
       x = "Values of an Unobserved Latent Variable")
  
```

### Conceptualizing an Ordinal Logistic Regression

$Y^*$ has various threshold points $\kappa$.

- The value of $Y$ is observed whether you've passed a certain threshold.

For example, when number of categories = 5:

- $Y_i$ = 1 if $Y^*_{i}$ is $\le$ $\kappa_1$
- $Y_i$ = 2 if $\kappa_1 \le Y^*_{i} \le \kappa_2$ 
- $Y_i$ = 3 if $\kappa_2 \le Y^*_{i} \le \kappa_3$ 
- $Y_i$ = 4  if $\kappa_3 \le Y^*_{i} \le \kappa_4$ 
- $Y_i$ = 5 if $Y^*_{i}$ is $\ge$ $\kappa_4$

### Conceptualizing an Ordinal Logistic Regression

In the population, the continuous latent variable $Y^*$ is equal to

$$
Y^* = \sum_{k=1}^{K}\beta_{k}X_{ki} + \epsilon_{i} = Z_{i} + \epsilon_{i} 
$$

Of note: that random disturbance term has a standard logistic distribution.

### Conceptualizing an Ordinal Logistic Regression

The ordinal logistic regression estimates part of the above.


$$
Z_i = \sum_{k=1}^{K}\beta_{k}X_{ki} = E(Y^*_{i} )
$$

Because $Z$ is not a perfect measure of $Y^*$, there are prediction errors.

- But, knowing the distribution of the error term, you can calculate those probabilities.

### Conceptualizing an Ordinal Logistic Regression

What you need to estimate from this design: the $\kappa$s, the $\beta$s in order to compute $Z_i = \sum_{k=1}^{K}\beta_{k}X_{ki}$.

- Note: there is no intercept term in this extension of the logistic model.

For shorthand we teach this as a "parallel lines" model.

- The ordinal logistic regression estimates one equation over all levels of the response variable.
- The estimate that emerges communicates the natural logged odds of going up (or down) a "level", all else equal.

## Assumptions/Diagnostics
### Assumptions/Diagnostics

Ordinal logistic regression is a GLM, so much still applies from logistic regression.

- e.g. deviance, log-likelihood, MLE

One important assumptions: parallel lines (proportional odds).

- The slope estimate between each pair of outcomes across two response levels are assumed to be the same regardless of which partition we consider.


### Assumptions/Diagnostics

There are no shortage of tests for this:

- Brant test
- LR test
- Wald test

Implication: violating the assumption means the ordinal logistic model is too restrictive.

- Consider a multinomial GLM instead.

## Conclusion
### Conclusion

If your DV is ordered-categorical, considered an ordinal logistic regression.

- OLS works much better with ordered-categorical DVs than binary DVs, but that's less the point.
    - Feel free to compare OLS with it, though OLS would be "wrong" in a non-trivial way.
- Think of these as situations where $Y^*$ is assumed but only a finite $Y$ is observed.

Ordinal logistic regression better models the nature of the data, but:

- check for parallel lines/proportional odds.
- coefficient interpretation is a little weirder.
    - my take: be prepared to communicate quantities of interest as probabilities.
